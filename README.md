Produce figures (plots) of the data in R Studio of the data– aim for journal publication quality, no minimum or maximum number but they must all be referred to in the summary and be meaningful – you will produce figures in your analysis but may not need to use them in the report (e.g. is the QQplot meaningful in a short summary?)
